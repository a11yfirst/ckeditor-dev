## About A11yFirst

### Project Description

The A11yFirst Project seeks to make the process of creating and editing
web documents one that proactively results in accessible content. This
is in contrast to the typical process that primarily relies upon
remediation of accessibility problems at the end of the authoring process.

For example, by prompting the author to provide information regarding links
and image properties as they are added to the document, and promoting block
actions and logical structure over inline styling, accessibility problems
are not only avoided, but authors learn on a feature-by-feature basis some
of the important requirements for accessible content.

With a better understanding of accessibility requirements as they relate
to specific features of their documents as content is being added, it is
hoped that authors will incorporate accessibility as a natural part of the
document editing process.
