## List

### How it works

Use the toolbar buttons to:

* Insert/Remove Numbered List
* Insert/Remove Bulleted List
* Increase Indent
* Decrease Indent

Additional properties such as list numbering and bullet types can be configured
by using the context menu and selecting:

* Numbered List Properties
* Bulleted List Properties

The context menu can be invoked by positioning the cursor in a list item and

* right-clicking, using the mouse, or
* using Mouse Keys on Windows or Mac.

### About lists

* Use a numbered list when the order or sequence of the items is significant.
* Use a bulleted list when the order of the items is not significant.

### Why lists are important

* Lists convey grouping semantics for related items.
* Lists may also convey hierarchical structure.
