## Block Format

### How it works

* A block format can be applied by placing your cursor within a text block and
selecting an item from the 'Block Format' menu.

* The baseline block format is 'Normal text', which is a simple paragraph.

* To remove an active block format, either toggle it off by selecting it in the
menu, or select the 'Normal text' option from the menu.

* Headings are a specialized type of block format which are specified using
the 'Heading' menu.

### Why it's important

* Thinking in terms of blocks within your document is a higher-level approach
to providing structure and semantics that are important for all users.

* Visual styling for block formats is predetermined by your organization, thus
freeing up your time and energy for concentrating on the structure and meaning
of the content within your document.
