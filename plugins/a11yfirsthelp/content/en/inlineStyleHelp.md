## Inline Style

### How it works

* To apply inline styles to existing text, select a range of text and then
choose an option from the menu.

* To apply inline styles to text you are about to type, choose an option from
the menu and begin typing. The style will continue to be applied until you
choose another option or move the cursor to a different point in the document.

* Multiple inline styles can be applied to selected text.

* Inline styles are applied differently than block formats. They require either
an inline selection of characters within a block, an empty selection where you
immediately insert characters, or in special circumstances, the selection of
one or more text blocks.

* If you apply an inline style to an empty selection, the characters that you
type immediately after choosing a style from the menu will have that style
applied to them.

* With an empty selection, if you choose an inline style and then do not type
any characters and change the position of the cursor, the style will not be
applied.

### Why it's important

* Thinking in terms of block formats first, and then using inline styles to
emphasize key words or phrases within text blocks, results in documents that
are easier to read and understand.

* Inline styles, when used properly, help screen reader users find and
understand the meaning of the lower level semantics of inline style changes.

* Inline styles are important semantically at a lower level than block formats.
For example, choosing 'Emphasis' for a word or phrase within a text block will
highlight them both visually and semantically, which is important for users of
assistive technologies such as screen readers.

* When block formats are considered as primary, and inline styles secondary,
many visual styling decisions are already made by default.
