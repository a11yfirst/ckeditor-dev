## Link

### How it works

* *Display Text* is the text that appears on your web page for the link.

* The *Display Text* must **not** be empty, since it results in the URL being
used as the display text for the link.

* The *Display Text* must **not** use ambiguous text, for example "Click Here"
or "More".

* The *Display Text* must **not** start with redunent text, including "Link" and
or "Link to".

* The *Display Text* should **not** be the URL of the link.

* The *Use URL as Display Text* checkbox allows the URL to be used as display
text and must **only** be used in special circumstances.

### About links

* Usable and accessible *Display Text* should be descriptive, unique and start with
keywords (NNG).

* The *Display Text* for links is like a sign post. It should tell you what
youâ€™ll find when you follow it (NOMENSA).

* Be consistent: Links to the same URL should have the same *Display Text*.

### Why it's important

* Descriptive link text makes it easier for everyone to find and follow links
on a page that are of interest to them.

* Descriptive link text is especially important for people using screen
readers, who typically only hear the display text spoken to them through speech
synthesis and do not "see" the link in the context of other content on the page.

* When URLs or ambiguous text are used as the display text for a link, it is
impossible in many cases, and much more difficult in the remaining cases, for
screen reader users to find and follow links of interest to them.
